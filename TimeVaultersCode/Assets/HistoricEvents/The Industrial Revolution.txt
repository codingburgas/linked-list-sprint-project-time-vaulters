Year: 1760

Beginning in Britain during the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution was a period of profound economic and technological transformation. Innovations such as the steam engine, spinning jenny, and power loom revolutionized manufacturing processes, leading to the rise of factories. This shift from agrarian, handcrafted production to industrialized, machine-driven methods resulted in significant social changes, including urbanization as people moved to cities for work. The era also saw the development of new transportation networks, such as railways and canals, which facilitated commerce and the spread of ideas. The Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for the modern industrialized world, influencing economic structures, labor systems, and daily life.
