Name: World War II
Date: 1st September 1939

World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, involving nations across the globe from 1939 to 1945. The war began with Germany's invasion of Poland, prompting Britain and France to declare war. It saw significant events such as the Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of other minorities were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany. The United States' entry into the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought significant resources to the Allied powers. The war concluded with the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers. In Europe, this led to the division of Germany into occupation zones, while in Asia, it resulted in the decolonization of many territories. The aftermath of World War II saw the establishment of the United Nations, aimed at preventing future conflicts, and set the stage for the ensuing Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.
