Name: Fall of the Berlin Wall
Date: November 9th 1989

The Berlin Wall, erected in 1961, was a concrete barrier dividing East and West Berlin during the Cold War, symbolizing the ideological conflict between communism and democracy. On November 9, 1989, amidst political changes and public pressure for greater freedoms, East German authorities announced that citizens could cross the border freely. Thousands gathered, and the wall was dismantled piece by piece. This event led to the reunification of Germany and signified the collapse of communist regimes across Eastern Europe. It also marked the end of the Cold War, leading to a new era of international relations and cooperation.â€‹
