Year: 476

The Western Roman Empire's decline culminated in 476 AD when Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, deposed the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus. This event marked the end of ancient Rome's dominance in the West and ushered in the Middle Ages. The empire's fall resulted from a combination of internal weaknesses, such as political instability and economic troubles, and external pressures from invading barbarian tribes. The vacuum left by Rome's collapse led to the emergence of various successor kingdoms and significantly reshaped Europe's political and cultural landscape.
