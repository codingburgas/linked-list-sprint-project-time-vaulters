Date: May 5th 1789

The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that fundamentally changed the course of French history. It began in 1789 with the convening of the Estates-General to address fiscal crises but quickly escalated as the Third Estate, representing commoners, proclaimed itself the National Assembly, asserting the right to govern France. Key events included the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, a symbolic act of defiance against royal authority. The revolution led to the abolition of the monarchy, the establishment of a secular and democratic republic, and the declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men. However, the revolution also resulted in internal conflicts, such as the Reign of Terror, where perceived enemies of the revolution were executed. Despite these challenges, the French Revolution dismantled feudal structures and inspired future movements advocating liberty, equality, and fraternity.
