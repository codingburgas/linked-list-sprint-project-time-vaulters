Name: Invention of the Printing Press
Year: 1440 

Around 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the movable-type printing press in Mainz, Germany, revolutionizing the production of books and written materials. This innovation drastically reduced the cost and time required to produce books, making literature more accessible to a broader audience. The spread of printed materials facilitated the spread of knowledge, literacy, and new ideas across Europe. It played a crucial role in the Protestant Reformation by enabling the rapid dissemination of Martin Luther's writings. The printing press also contributed to the Scientific Revolution by allowing scientists to share their discoveries widely. This technological advancement laid the foundation for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of information in the subsequent centuries.
