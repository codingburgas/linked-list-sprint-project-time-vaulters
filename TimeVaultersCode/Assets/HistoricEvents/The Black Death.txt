Name: The Black Death
Year: 1347 - 1351

The Black Death, also known as the Bubonic Plague, swept through Europe, Asia, and North Africa between 1347 and 1353, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 25 million people in Europe aloneâ€”about one-third of the population. The disease was transmitted via fleas on rats and spread rapidly through trade routes. The massive death toll led to significant labor shortages, which in turn caused economic upheavals and social transformations. Many survivors experienced improved wages and living conditions due to the scarcity of workers. Additionally, the plague prompted widespread religious and philosophical questioning, challenging existing beliefs and paving the way for the Renaissance.
