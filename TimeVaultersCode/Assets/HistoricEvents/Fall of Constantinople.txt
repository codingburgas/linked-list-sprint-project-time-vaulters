Name: Fall of Constantinople
Date: 29th of May 1453

The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire and a significant shift in global power dynamics. After a 53-day siege, the Ottoman forces led by Sultan Mehmed II breached the city's formidable walls. This conquest not only provided the Ottomans with control over key trade routes between Europe and Asia but also facilitated the spread of Renaissance knowledge eastward. The fall prompted European nations to seek alternative routes to Asia, leading to the Age of Exploration. It also resulted in the migration of Greek scholars to the West, preserving and transmitting classical knowledge. The event significantly altered the balance of power in Europe and the Middle East, influencing cultural, economic, and political developments for centuries.â€‹
