Name: Christopher Columbus' Voyage 
Date: August 3rd 1492

In 1492, Christopher Columbus, an Italian navigator sponsored by Spain, embarked on a westward voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, aiming to find a new route to Asia. Instead, on October 12, 1492, he landed in the Bahamas, inadvertently initiating European exploration and colonization of the Americas. Columbus's journey opened the way for the widespread exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between the Old and New Worlds, known as the Columbian Exchange. However, it also led to the exploitation and decimation of indigenous populations, leaving a complex legacy that continues to influence the Americas today.
