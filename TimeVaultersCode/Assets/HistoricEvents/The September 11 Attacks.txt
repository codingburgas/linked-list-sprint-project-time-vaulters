Name: The September 11 Attacks
Date: September 11th 2001


â€‹On September 11, 2001, 19 terrorists from the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four commercial airplanes, executing coordinated suicide attacks against prominent U.S. targets. Two planes struck the World Trade Center's North and South Towers in New York City, leading to their eventual collapse. A third plane hit the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, causing significant structural damage. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers attempted to overcome the hijackers. These attacks resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. In response, the U.S. initiated the "War on Terror," launching military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The events also led to significant changes in domestic and international policies, including enhanced security measures and a reevaluation of foreign relations.
