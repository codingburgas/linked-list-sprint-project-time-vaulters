Name: The Reformation
Date: October 31st 1517

The Reformation was a religious movement that began on October 31st 1517, challenging the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Initiated by figures like Martin Luther, who famously nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the church door in 1517, the movement called for reforms in church practices and beliefs. This led to the creation of Protestant denominations and significant changes in religious and cultural life across Europe. The Reformation also spurred the translation of the Bible into vernacular languages, making religious texts more accessible to the general populace. Its impact extended beyond religion, influencing art, politics, and education, and paving the way for the modern era.
