# 🕰️ Time Vault

**Time Vault** is a C++ program dedicated to archiving and cataloging historic events across time. Designed for researchers, history enthusiasts, and developers, Time Vault offers a structured way to store, view, and manage notable events from various time periods—all through an intuitive, menu-driven interface.

## 📜 Features

- 📅 Add historic events with dates, titles, and descriptions
- 🔍 Search events by year, keyword, or category
- 📂 Organize events chronologically or thematically

## 💾 How It Works

**Time Vault** stores and reads data for the events by using external files. Linked lists are also used for easy navigation, creation, modification and deletion of your events.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., **g++** or **clang++**)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repo)
- A terminal or command prompt
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad++, or an IDE like Visual Studio)
